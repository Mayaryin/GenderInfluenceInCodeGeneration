    "### Problems:\n",
    "- \"Have fun and good luck!\" gets positivity score of 0.98 but is a part of a copied assignment paper and is an errror from the parsing process ✅ fixed\n",
    "- \"Some prompts may only contain code, some only conversational text, the some only other parts, and some of them a mix of components.\" is still a leaked system prompt ✅ fixed\n",
    "- \"I am using datalore and I think I cannot install things.\" gets a negativity score of 0.81 but its actually neutral. \"Why are the values so weird? because it is scaled?\" get a negativity score of 0.7 but is definitely more negative.\n",
    "- \"Please make it tougher, I am not a baby.\" gets 0.69 but should be even more negative\n",
    "- \"I added a new plot-expanded functionality in abalone, but my import does not seem to recognize the new version of abalone.com Analytical It gives me this error to attributeErrorErrorError 1A abalone object has no attribute \\'plotexpanded\\'\\'.\" gets high negativity but is neutral\n",

    "## --> Mask out code parts entirely to maintain syntactical structure?\n",
    "## --> use an LLM and apply different prompts or provide few shot examples?"
